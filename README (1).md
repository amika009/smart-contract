# ETH+AVAX MODULE 2 FRONTEND PROJECT


This repository contains my Metacrafters frontend DApp project that interacts with a Solidity smart contract deployed on the local Ethereum network. The DApp allows users to perform deposit and withdraw operations and also includes additional functionalities.
## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

npm run dev
#### or
yarn dev
#### or
pnpm dev
#### or
bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
