ETH+AVAX MODULE 2 FRONTEND PROJECT
This repository contains my Metacrafters frontend DApp project that interacts with a Solidity smart contract deployed on the local Ethereum network. The DApp allows users to perform deposit and withdraw operations and also includes additional functionalities.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

npm run dev

or
yarn dev

or
pnpm dev

or
bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
